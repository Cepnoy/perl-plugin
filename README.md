perl-plugin
===========

build, deploy and test perl based applications with Jenkins CI server 

prerequisites
===

following packages should be installed:

- [App::cpanminus](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?App%3A%3Acpanminus)
- ruby installed with rvm in `single-user install mode`
- ruby bundler

exported builders
===

## perl_builder

This is the smart builder for perl based applications. Builder algorithm is:

- for every subdirectory in `$WORKSPACE/svn/*/` list founds "last tag" directory (with the biggest version postfix) -  `$WORKSPACE/svn/*/<last_tag>`
- for every `<last_tag>` directory:
    - cwd `<last_tag>`
    - set-up local::lib environment 
    - adds $WORKSPACE/cpanlib directory to local::lib environment
    - runs installation from current working directory with [cpanminus](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?cpanm) client
- if `<last_tag>` directory is held in `$WORKSPACE/svn/app/` directory:
    - creates `distributive` from `<last_tag>` directory with [Module::Build](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module%3A%3ABuild) installer 
    - copies $WORKSPACE/cpanlib to distributive tarball (incremental build!)
    - copies distributive tarball to artifacts directory ($WORKSPACE/build)
    - copies notes.markdown file and patches text-area content to ($WORKSPACE/build)


### example layout:

    $WORKSPACE/svn/module/version-0.0.1
    $WORKSPACE/svn/module/version-0.0.2
    $WORKSPACE/svn/app/version-0.1.0
    $WORKSPACE/svn/app/version-0.2.0

- `<last_tag>` directories found: $WORKSPACE/svn/module/version-0.0.2, $WORKSPACE/svn/app/version-0.2.0, 
- `distributive` made from directory: $WORKSPACE/svn/app/version-0.2.0

### interface:

![perl_builder interface](https://raw.github.com/melezhik/perl-plugin/master/images/perl-builder-interface.png "perl_builder interface")

- `run build process`: enable/disable builder
- `enable catalyst debug mode`: run catalyst tests in debug mode
- `do not lookup last tag`: do not find last tags in `$WORKSPACE/svn/*/` directories, runs installation from `$WORKSPACE/svn/*/` directories
- `chef json template`: [ERB](http://www.stuartellis.eu/articles/erb/) template for generated [chef json file](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Setting+the+run_list+in+JSON+during+run+time) (see further for explanation)
- `verbosity type`: level of verbosity of output in Jenkins console

### chef json template
If you define one, perl_builder will generate chef json file, based on the template. Check out chef wiki to get know about chef json files. 
The only important perl_builder do about json file is adding link to artifact URL to it.

### advanced options:

![patches text-area](https://raw.github.com/melezhik/perl-plugin/master/images/perl_builder_patches.png "patches text-area")

Patches are just stanzas in cpanminus client format, they are passed to cpanminus client as arguments. 
The reason you may want to use patches is to forcefully install some problematic cpan modules or install downgraded versions. 
Patches are the right way to do this. Once patches are applied you may comment them or prepend with `--skip-satisfied` flag. 
Check out http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?cpanm for details.

Patches examples:

    # any comments start with '#'
    -f Math::Currency # forcefully installation
    --skip-satisfied CGI DBI~1.2

exported publishers
===

***before add perl_publisher as post-build actions add artifacts archivator as follows !!! ***

![archived artifacts ](https://raw.github.com/melezhik/perl-plugin/master/images/archive_artefacts.png "archived artifacts")

- artifact candidates should be taken from `$WORKSPACE/build` directory

## perl_publisher

This publisher should be logically run after perl_builder, it does two things:

- run chef-client on remote server (see deploy on remote server section)
- run cucumber tests (see run cucumber tests section)

### deploy on remote server
chef-client will be run on remote server with chef json file generated by perl_builder for you, ssh public-key authentication schema is used.

![perl_publisher_chef](https://raw.github.com/melezhik/perl-plugin/master/images/perl_publisher_chef.png "perl_publisher_chef interface")

### run cucumber tests

Cucumber tests may be optionally run, it's simple wrapper around `bundle exec cucumber` command.  Directory layout should follow this scheme:

    $WORKSPACE/cucumber/test-suite-one/
    $WORKSPACE/cucumber/test-suite-two/
    $WORKSPACE/cucumber/test-suite-three/
    # etc

- perl_publisher run `bundle exec cucumber` command from every subdirectory in `$WORKSPACE/cucumber/`


![perl_publisher_cucumber](https://raw.github.com/melezhik/perl-plugin/master/images/perl_publisher_cucumber.png "perl_publisher_cucumber interface")



# Environment setup

You can set environment variables via "Jenkins/Configuration/Global properties/Environment variables" interface to adjust plugin behavior.

## cpan_mirror
Setup one if you have custom cpan mirror, for example private mini cpan server.
    
    http://my.private.cpan.local

## http_proxy
Standard way to do things when you behind http proxy server.

    http://my.proxy.server

## cucumber\_ruby\_version
perl_publisher runs tests with rvm installed ruby of `default version 1.8.7`, specify another one if you have ruby installed of another version.

    1.9.3

## LC_ALL
Setup your standard encoding.

    ru_RU.UTF-8
